### Jeff Gothelf - Lean UX in Enterprise

Jeff shares the dirty secret of lean startup. Lean + Agile = Nice flavor of continuos learning.

1. At the core of continuos learning is **experimentation** and **humility**. Startups live in a world of experiment or die. Enterprise are very much different. In enterprise we don't adopt a way of experimentation and humility, and yet we're all talking about agile + lean.

How do we move past hurdles of corporation?

>> "If you are company that scales or want to scale in 21 century, you are first and foremost a software business."

Scale principles, not process. Lean principles that scale across teams.

- Principle 1 - customer value = business value
  - OKRs are a good to start (Great book "Radical Focus")
- Principle 2 - Value learning over delivery
  - Build small teams
  - build momentum with small teams
  - set-up sandboxes
- Principle 3 - Radical Transparency
  - Transparency through rituals
  - Access to customers
  - Access to data
- Principle 4 - Humility in all things
  - Donald Trump != humility
  - Modern staffing model (not need for project managers)
  - Modernize a tech stack (how long does it take from prototype to reality?)
