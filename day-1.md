Day 1 - Startup Tours

To start off, we all met at the Hyatt wharf, registered and hopped on the bus to visit a few startups in the city. We started off by visiting Pivotal Labs, then Breacher, Farm Girl Flowers, and lastly Carbon Five. Farm Girl Flowers was probably our best visit. We got interacted with the founder and ask questions. It was very insightful!
